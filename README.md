### Hi, I'm Jitendra ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer focused on building practical solutions to real-world problems.

Here are a couple of things I'm currently working on:

*   **[MockSensei](https://mocksensei.com)**: An AI-powered platform that generates mock tests for Indian government job aspirants.
*   **[StoredIn](https://stored-in.vercel.app)**: A simple ERP solution to help small and medium Indian stores manage their sales, inventory, customers, and suppliers.

I'm always interested in exploring new ideas in the AI space and am open to collaborating on interesting projects.
